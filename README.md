Giftastic is a dynamic page using Giphy's API to produce GIFs based on the users actions.
The theme is flowers- a few types of flowers are in an array and pushed to a search bar. Users can click the flower name and GIFS will be displayed.

The GIFs are displayed as still images and upon click, animate, upon another click, they will go back to still. 

The user also has the option to search for their own term or flower and then click the displayed link to then produce GIFs from Giphy API.
